### SHA1 Hash finder!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<pre>
Before I discovered 'Make', I thought of making a command line tool that would
compile all my C++ assignment files in 1 command. And only compile the ones that
had any changes made to them in order to make it faster âš¡. So, I thought of 
using the SHA1 hashing algorithm to calculate the hashes of all files in my
assignments directory and save them in a database file and only compile the ones
which had changed.

Soon after I (somehow) implemented the SHA1 algorithm from the FIPS PUB 180-1
(https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub180-1.pdf) paper, I
discovered 'Make' and ditched the project.
